# How It Works

A **LORROS Meeting** is like a group blog where members can post their comments and replies on each Agenda Item _(like a blog post)_. Motions can be attached to each Agenda Item and Group Members can [Vote](../voting/intro).

## Notice of Meeting

A **Meeting** can be scheduled by a Group Administrator. He/She creates the agenda and then submits _(sends the Notice of Meeting)_ to the Group Members by email.

## Meeting Home Page

Everything associsted with the **Meeting** is accessed from the Meeting Home Page.

## Adding Agenda Items

If the **Meetings** hasn't started, any Member can add Agenda Items to the Draft Agenda.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/meetings/add agenda item.gif')} />

Once the **Meeting** starts, you can add [Comments](/docs/started/General%20Usage/intro#adding-comments), [Replies](/docs/started/General%20Usage/intro#adding-replies) and [Vote](/docs/meetings/voting/intro)
