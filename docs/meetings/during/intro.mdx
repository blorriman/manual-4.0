## Voting on Motions

### Quorum

The **Quorum** can be found by clicking the **Voting** tab.

<center>
	<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/meetings/quorum.gif')} />
</center>

:::info Info
The **Quorum** for each group defaults to 50% +1 of the voting Members, however the Group Admin can manually change the quorum.
:::

### Move/Second

As per **Robert's Rules of Order**, a Motion **must** be Moved and Seconded before Members can vote on it.

</center>

:::note Note
In LORROS _(as a convenience)_, the Mover can vote prior to the Motion being Seconded; however, the vote is not registered until the Motion is Seconded.
:::

### Voting

<center>
	<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/meetings/voting.gif')} />
</center>

Once you have voting, you can change your vote at any time prior to the end of the Meeting _(this is only available with **Blind** voting)_.

:::note Note
LORROS defaults to **Blind** voting; however, the Group Admin can select **Visible** and/or **Secret** voting.
Learn more about how LORROS handles the different ballot options _([click here](../voting/intro#ballot-options))_.
:::

### Participants

In **Blind** voting _(default)_, the Members who have voted are shown as **Participants**.

<center>
	<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/meetings/participants.gif')} />
</center>

:::note Note
If **Visiible** voting is selected, the results of the voting is displayed.
:::

### Amend the Motion

Once a Motion has been Moved and Seconded, any voting Member can **Amend the Motion**

:::caution Caution
**Amendments** must be _germane_ to the Motion and **NOT** a new Motion.
:::

<center>
	<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/meetings/amend-1.jpg')} />
</center>

The Member amending the Motion is the Mover and a Seconder is required before anyone can vote on the Amenendment.
