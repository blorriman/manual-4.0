## Group Files

All Files associated with the Group Activities are accesible from the **Group Files** tab. Once the Group Files are opened, you can:

> 1. **Filter** by Activity or File Type.
> 1. **Search** by File Name.
> 1. **Link** to the File.
> 1. **Link** to the Activity _(ie: Meeting, Discussion, etc.)_.

:::info Info
There is a **Group Resources** tab for files that are NOT associated with an activity, but are associated with the Group - such as _Bylaws, Rules & Regulations, etc._
:::

## Drafts

The **Drafts** tab opens up a list of any Activities _(Discussions, etc.)_ that you have started but NOT submitted to the Group. The list allows you to link directly to the Activity to complete the setup, or Delete the Draft.

## Affiliates

**Affiliate Groups** are Groups that are associated _(affiliated)_ with your Group, such as Committees _(or a Parent Group if your Group is a Committee)_. Affiliate groups also extend to sibling Groups _(other Committees created by your Parent Group)_. NOTE: your Group is highlighted.

> 1. **Link** to the Activity _(ie: Meeting, Discussion, etc.)_.
