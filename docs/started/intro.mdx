# First Steps

### Self Register

If you are not registered with **LORROS**, click the Register link at the bottom of the Log In form. We require your email address, full name and password _(must be at least 6 characters)_.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/started/image5.gif')} />

Once you have filled the form and registered you will be required to confirm your email. An email will be sent to you with a confirmation link – clicking the link finishes the registration process and opens your home page.

`put copy of Registration email`

### Invitation to **LORROS**

When an invitation is sent out from a group, you will receive an email with a button to join the **Group**.

The email also includes a button to register with **LORROS** _(if you are not already)_. Once registered, simply click the **JOIN THE GROUP** or **JOIN THE DISCUSSION** button in the email. As soon as you click the button, you will be taken to either the **Group** page or the **Discussion**.

There are two types of invitations – to join a **Group** or to join a **Discussion** _(see Guest Links)_
