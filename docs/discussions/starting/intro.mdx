# Starting a Discussion

> **Discussion:** _The action or process of talking about something in order to reach a decision or to exchange ideas._

A **Discussion** should be about "_exchnaging ideas_". If you just want to send a quick email, use the [Group Email](/docs/started/Group%20Actions/intro#send-an-email) on the **Group Home Page**.

### Setting an End Date

No one wants an endless Discussion, so **LORROS** allows you to set the **End Date** for each Discussion _(the default is 7 days)_.

:::info Info
When the Discussion has ended _(archived)_, the Group Admin can [reset the End Date](/administration/discussions/intro).
